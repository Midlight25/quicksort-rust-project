# Quicksort Rust Project

## Why?

It is 2021, I'm currently studying Design and Analysis of Algorithms. My professor decided to give us a project on implementing Quick Sort in the language of our choosing. I decided to use Rust, because it's a top language to learn according to multiple StackOverflow dev surveys. This is the fruits of my labor, a semi-descent generic implementation of Quick Sort for collections with items that are orderable.

## Commands

- `cargo build` - Build and save an executable of this program
- `cargo run` - Build and run an executable of this program without saving it.
